🚫 **BLOCKED: Direct registry.ts edits are not allowed!**

`registry.ts` is auto-generated by the build process.

**DO NOT edit this file directly.**

Instead:
1. Edit the source component in `src/components/ui/`
2. Run `npm run build` in `packages/cli`
3. The registry will be regenerated automatically
